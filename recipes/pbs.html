        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Makes 1 sandwich</p>
            <p>This sounds revolting.  It doesn't look great either. Are you sure you didn't mean to search for 
                <a href="./pbj.html">Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich</a>?
            </p>
            <p>If you're sure, here's how I assume you would make this. You never know - sometimes odd flavors work surprisingly well together!</p>


        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 slices of bread</li>
                <li>Spam to taste</li>
                <li>Peanut butter to taste</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat a shallow pan or skillet.</li>
                <li>Thinly slice as much spam as you want on your sandwich.
                    and add it to the pan.</li>
                <li>Fry spam on medium-low heat until it is toasted on one side.
                    Then flip it over and fry until the other side is toasted and the spam
                    is warm all the way through.  Remove Spam from pan and set aside.</li>
                <li>While spam is cooking, spread peanut butter on one slice of bread. </li>
                <li>Place fried spam on the peanut buttered bread, then 
                    top the sandwich with the second slice of bread.</li>
                <li>Fry the sandwich in the pan of hot spam grease until the bread is toasted.
                    Flip over and fry the other side.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately.  How does it taste?</li>
            </ol
